    <h1>The Story Of The Camel That Married a Giraffe</h1>
    
    <p>Once upon a time the lived a camel, his name was Elvin and readily enjoyed martinis shaken once.</p>
    <p>He has lived at the Toronto Zoo his entire life, giving camel rides to passing by humans. He enjoyed his job of letting people ride on his humps.</p>
    <p>As the years went by Elvis became depressed and the Zoo staff noticed this. The staff decided to move him to a different spot in the zoo and this is where he met Darlene.</p>
    <p>Darlene was Elvis's new neighbour. She was a 15 ft Giraffe and had just moved to the Zoo.</p>
    <p>Elvis and Darlene hung out every night after the zoo closed, they would eat supper together and tell each out about how they're days went.</p>
    <p>As the months went by, Elvis started feeling something strange with his heart. He was in love.</p>
    <p>Elvis decided he would ask to marry Darlene but he wanted it to be an amazing suprise! He told the zoo staff his plan they helped him create the perfect proposal.</p>
    <p>Because Elvis was only 6 ft tall and Darlene was 15 ft tall, Darlene would always have to lay low to get to Elvis's level. The zoo staff created a 10 ft stand for Elvis to climb and get to Darlenes level.</p>
    <p>Once Elvis got to the top, he made his proposal to Darlene and she said yes!</p>
    
    <br>
    <p>The rest of the story is history but I can happily tell you that Elvis the Camel and Darlene the Giraffe are still happily married and kickin today!</p>
    <p>The end.</p>
